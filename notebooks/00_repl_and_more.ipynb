    "The Biggest difference between Julia REPL and other REPLs is that it has different prompt modes. Following are the modes you can use in Julia REPL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Julian Mode**: This is the default mode of the REPL. In this mode, you can type Julia commands and see the results immediately. The prompt looks like this (in green color)\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```code\n",
    "   julia>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can type any valid Julia expression here, and it will be evaluated immediately. For example:\n",

    "   ```code\n",
    "   julia> 2 + 2\n",
    "   4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is the most common mode you will use in the REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shell Mode**: In this mode, you can run shell commands directly from the REPL. You can enter this mode by typing `;` at the prompt. The prompt will change to (in red color):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```code\n",
    "   shell>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this mode, you can run any shell command, and the output will be displayed in the REPL. For example:\n",

    "   ```code\n",
    "   shell> cd /path/to/directory\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will change the current working directory to `/path/to/directory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Package Mode**: In this mode, you can manage Julia packages directly from the REPL. You can enter this mode by typing `]` at the prompt. The prompt will change to (in blue color):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```code\n",
    "   (@v1.11) pkg>\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   ```code\n",
    "   (@v1.11) pkg> add Plots\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will install the `Plots` package.\n",

    "4. **Help Mode**: In this mode, you can get help on Julia functions and packages. You can enter this mode by typing `?` at the prompt. The prompt will change to (in yellow color):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```code\n",
    "   help?>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "   help?> println\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will display the documentation for the `println` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Search Mode**: In this mode, you can search through REPL logs saved in `~/.julia/logs/repl_history.jl`. You can enter this mode by typing `Ctrl + R` at the prompt. The prompt will change to:\n",
